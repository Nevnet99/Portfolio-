        My name is Luke, and I am a front-end developer with 4 years of
        experience. I specialise in building modern, responsive websites and web
        applications.
        <br />
        <br />I am passionate about creating intuitive and engaging user
        experiences, and I believe that clean, well-designed code is the key to
        achieving this. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the
        latest technologies and best practices in the industry.
